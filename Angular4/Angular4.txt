* Creating an angular app
	Open a new folder
	=> ng new <appName>
	eg ng new a4app

* run application on development server
	=> cd <appName>
	=> ng serve
	By default it will start app on 4200
	open your browser on http://localhost:4200/
* package.json is metafile
	contains scripts dependencies...
* app.module.ts contains information for all modules/services/components
	refer a4app comments


* to create a Angular component	(using angular cli)
	* create new folder components (just for modularity)
	* => ng g component <componentPath/Componentname> // g is for generate
		a4app>> eg ng g component components/user
		
	this will add user component in app.module.ts as well
	will create user.html and user.ts files
	
* Use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ for fake Rest API's

* To create a Angular Service
	* create new folder Services
	* => ng g service <servicePath/serviceName>
	a4app>> ng g service services/userData
	
	but for service you need to manually add in app.module.ts
	rest files inside service/serviceName would be created on its own
