<!-- $scope is per controller == each controller has its own scope
    however every angular application has a default global scope called the 'root scope'.Outside
    any controller, its the root scope that applies.
    scope hierachy is like incase of nested controllers
    1) First the lookup is in inner Ctlr scope object
    2) not found, then lookup is in outer/parent Ctlr if exists
    3) finally lookup is in root scope
