<!--see the script scetion
    Angular application should have module to refer to through ng-app directive 
    without mentioning in ng-app directive , it will have default module but to register controllers/functions
    one should have your own module
    module can have multiple controllers 
    you have to register the function with controller
    within div tag the mainFunction is called
-->
<html ng-app="myApp"><!-- refers module myApp-->
    <head>
        <script src="angular.js"></script>
    </head>
    
    <!-- <body ng-init="varName=10">  look in script how to initialize variable using angular-->
    <body >
        <div ng-controller="MainCtlr"><!-- refers controller MainCtlr-->
            <h1>Heading</h1>
            <p ng-if=varName < 11 >conditional paragraph</p>

            <p>the value is: {{varName}}</p>
        </div>
        <script>
            // angular is a global object created by angular.js
            var module = angular.module("myApp", []);
            module.controller("MainCtlr", mainFunction);//JS does not allow method overloading
            // mainFunction is a global function
            function mainFunction($scope){//to refer the 'scope' object of angular using DI, angular injects object 'scope' 
            //by reffering with '$'
            //$scope method parameter is not neccessary but we can access by asking angular to inject it
                $scope.varName = 10;
                console.log("Main called from Div!!");
            }
        </script>
    </body>
